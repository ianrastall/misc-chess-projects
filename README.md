The file edo.ssp is an Scid ratings file.

Lc0 test games are what I call "Artemis" games. I define that as games that are at least 10 moves, with at least 2300 Elo for both players. That result is then filtered through Stefan Pohl's Interesting Wins Search Tool, keeping only the "very interesting" wins. That result is then filtered in ChessBase, keeping only games that are both "strong" and "beautiful", with three-medals for a beauty score. This reduces ~1.5 GB to ~2 MB.

The processed-ccc takes the raw Chess.com Computer Chess Championship PGNs and unannotates, adds a version number and ratings to the engines, adds a bit of tournament information, and adds beauty scores. The full CCC can be found at Chess Nerd in the PGN repository: https://1drv.ms/f/c/91ee28d00abf9121/EonO2qJ4ZNdJuOKtqT1jIAEBcaw8K7evRpVF7DaxM26XJg?e=GmQ02g
