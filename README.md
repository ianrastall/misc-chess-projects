The file edo.ssp is an Scid ratings file.

Lc0 test games are what I call "Artemis" games. I define that as games between 10-100 moves, with at least 2300 Elo for both players, and that end in checkmate. That result is then filtered through Stefan Pohl's Interesting Wins Search Tool, keeping only the "very interesting" wins. That result is then filtered in ChessBase, keeping only games that are both "strong" and "beautiful", with three-medals for a beauty score.
